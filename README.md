**Slide 2: Manual Process (Before Automation)**

**Challenges Faced:**
- Extracting known and unknown errors manually from Oracle DB.
- Manually copying and pasting error data into Excel sheets.
- Handling wrap text and transferring data into the Remedy Tracker.
- Manually checking errors against SOP documents.
- Time-consuming and prone to human errors.

**Example:**

**Slide 3: Automated Solution (Using VBA Scripting)**

**How It Works:**
1. User pastes errors into the automation sheet.
2. VBA script automatically extracts wrap text and identifies errors.
3. The script checks errors against SOP_Errors.
4. It categorizes errors as **Matched** or **Unmatched**.
5. It fetches the corresponding **Resolution Comments**.
6. The **Vendor Name** is extracted if available.
7. The formatted output is generated with proper alignment and coloring.
